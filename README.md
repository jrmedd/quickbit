# Overview

Quick Bit was inspired by my love of [quick time events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quick_time_event) in games. Some of my favourite games ever have used it: Dragon's Lair, Shenmue, Resident Evil 4, and Metal Gear Rising included. It's a neat mechanic, easy to pick up, nerve-wracking, and endlessly frustrating when you fuck up.

It's part of loose series of games I'm *slowly* working on, including [The Mashing](https://github.com/jrmedd/TheMashingWeb)

Originally, I knocked up the game in around an hour for the BBC micro:bit. It came a very popular game as part of the [GameFace](https://gameface.xyz) workshops I've run, as well at various events I've attended since late 2016 when I first wrote it. I'm porting it to put into an Arcade Machine.
